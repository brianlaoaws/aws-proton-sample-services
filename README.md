# AWS Proton Sample Services

This repository contains samples of application code that can be deployed with AWS Proton using the [AWS Proton Sample Services](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-proton-sample-templates/tree/main/service-templates). 

- ## ecs-backend

  This AWS Lambda / ECS Dual Deploy Sample Application demonstrates the steps necessary to build a container image that runs on both AWS Lambda and on another container service like AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS). [README](./ecs-backend)

- ## ecs-ping-backend-a-record

    These REST API examples demonstrate end-to-end implementations of a simple application using a serverless approach that includes CI/CD pipelines, automated unit and integration testing, and workload observability. The examples include multiple implementations of the same application using a variety of development platform and infrastructure as a code approaches. The patterns here will benefit beginners as well as seasoned developers looking to improve their applications by automating routine tasks. [README](./ecs-ping-backend-a-record)
